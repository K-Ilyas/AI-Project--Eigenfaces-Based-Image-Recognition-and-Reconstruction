# Eigenfaces-Based Image Recognition and Reconstruction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements **image recognition and reconstruction** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and the **Eigenfaces method**. The goal is to recognize human faces and reconstruct occluded parts using training data.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
- **Compute Eigenfaces** from a dataset of images.
- **Project new images** into the Eigenfaces space.
- **Recognize faces** using **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**.
- **Reconstruct occluded images** using the closest match from the dataset.
- **Evaluate recognition performance** by analyzing distance distributions.

This project is particularly useful in **face recognition**, **image compression**, and **data dimensionality reduction**.
